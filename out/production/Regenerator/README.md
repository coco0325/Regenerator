# Regenerator
Regenerator is a perpetual world plugin that supports many grief prevention plugins

# License
This is not a license. It is a way to keep the developer of the plugin happy, without screwing you over in the process.

- Regenerator code must not be included in closed-source works and this github repository must be referenced in the comments of your code if you borrow large chunks of code from here.
- Regenerator must be redistributed unmodified and from its SpigotMC page only. You can offer me a pull request for an 'optional' feature, just create a configuration option to turn it off by default. As long as its useful and the code is good - it will be accepted.
